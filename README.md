# SSNGNN_v2
Solid Solution Nested Graph Neural Network (with edge features in the compositional graph)
  
**Note:** This package is the version with edge features in the compositional graph.  
          For the version without edge features in the compositional graph, e.g., study of the randomly distributed high-entropy alloys, please refer to the first version [SSNGNN_v1](https://github.com/Yidingwyd/SSNGNN).

# Brief review
SSNGNN provides a unified end-to-end representation learning framework for solid solution materials.   
In simple terms, SSNGNN consists of two layers in a nested graph representation: an inner compositional graph and an outer structural graph.  
   * The inner compositional graph captures the compositional information of the solid solution by representing different elements and their interactions at each lattice site.  
   * The outer structural graph models the overall crystal structure, aggregating features from the compositional graphs based on the spatial arrangement of lattice sites.  

# How to cite
Our paper is in submission now.

# Prerequisites
This Python package requires: pytorch, torch_scatter, scikit-learn, pymatgen, pandas, numpy, json.

# Usage
## Input of the SSNGNN  
Two `.json` files are required to be input into the SSNGNN:  
* Input dataset.  
* Atomic embeddings.

As an example, one can refer to the [NiCoCr - SFE dataset](https://github.com/Yidingwyd/SSNGNN_v2/blob/main/Kfold/NiCoCr.json) or [NiAl - energy dataset](https://github.com/Yidingwyd/SSNGNN_v2/blob/main/Kfold/Ni3Al.json).  
The **input dataset** of the SSNGNN should be saved as a python dictionary (named as `dataset dictionary`) in a `.json` file. 
* `dataset dictionary`:  
\- key - ID of each sample;  
\-  valule - `sample dictionary`.
* `sample dictionary`:  
\- keys `a`, `b`, `c`, `alpha`, `beta`, and `gamma` - the lattice parameters that describe the unit cell;  
\- key `comp` - `site dictionary`;  
\- key `target` - target (property) of the sample.  
* `site dictionary`:  
\- key - the relative positions of lattice sites, enclosed in square brackets [];  
\- value - `composition dictionary`.
* `composition dictionary`:
\- key - element symbols;
\- value - `element dictionary`.  
* `element dictionary`:  
\- key `fraction` - the fraction of the element at the specific site;  
\- key `edge` - the edges between this element and other elements (e.g., Warren-Cowley parameters), the order of which is consistent with the order of elements in the `composition dictionary`.  
A sample representing a FCC solid solution with chemical short-range ordering is partly shown below:

Another input file is the **atomic embeddings**, i.e., features in the nodes of the compositional graphs. We used one-hot features for both cases. The atomic embeddings are available at [data](https://github.com/Yidingwyd/SSNGNN_v2/tree/main/data). Users may try other atomic embeddings, which are also saved as a python dictionary in a `.json` file.  

Based on the input files, the program will automatically generate PyTorch tensors in a style of nested graph representation.  
## Train a SSNGNN model  
You can train a SSNGNN model by:  
```
python main_new.py --task regression --train_data train_set_path --val_data val_set_path --embedding atomic_embedding_path --savepath model_save_path --epochs 1000 
```
The model will be saved after every epoch, and the best model which shows the best performance on the validation set will be saved as `best.pth.tar` in the `model_save_path`.  
The input parameters of the model are summarized in the following tableï¼š  
![Table 1](https://github.com/Yidingwyd/SSNGNN/blob/main/table1.png)  
## Predict using a trained SSNGNN model
You can predict by:  
```
python predict.py --task regression  --test_data test_set_path --embedding atomic_embedding_path --modelpath model_path --savepath predictioin_results_save_path_and_name_ended_by_xlsx  
```
It should be noted that if any of the hyperparameters listed in the above table are modified during training, the same settings must be used during prediction. Meanwhile, the atomic embeddings must remain consistent with that used during training.  
  
The order of samples in the generated `.xlsx` file is consistent with that in the test set. The "formula" column is provided for reference only and does not represent the actual chemical formula.
